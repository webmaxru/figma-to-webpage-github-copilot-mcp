# Figma to HTML/CSS Conversion with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode in combination with the Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to efficiently convert Figma designs into fully functional, responsive HTML/CSS webpages.

> **Note:** The results of my own experiment with this approach can be found in the `demo-result` folder. Feel free to explore it for a real-world example of what can be achieved.

Watch the complete setup and usage process walkthrough in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eZMmQ8_XkA). The video demonstrates how to configure the Figma MCP server, connect it with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, and convert a Figma design into code.

## Overview

This project showcases the conversion of a Marketing Agency Landing Page from Figma into a responsive webpage using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). The implementation focuses on:

- Accurate reproduction of the Figma design
- Responsive layout with media queries
- CSS animations and hover effects
- Proper image assets organization
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## What is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode?

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is an advanced AI assistant that can help developers with complex tasks, including converting design mockups into code. It excels at understanding context, following detailed instructions, and generating code that matches design specifications.

## What is Figma MCP Server?

The Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables GitHub Copilot to directly access and analyze Figma designs. This integration allows Copilot to:

1. Parse the structure of Figma designs
2. Extract assets and images
3. Understand the design system (colors, typography, spacing)
4. Generate code that accurately reflects the design

## How to Use This Approach

To convert your own Figma designs to code using this approach:

1. Ensure you have access to GitHub Copilot with Agent Mode
2. Set up the Figma MCP server connection
3. Prepare your Figma design with properly named layers and components
4. Use the sample prompt below as a starting point

## Sample Prompt

Here's a sample prompt to use with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:

```
I have a Figma design for a marketing agency landing page that I need to convert to HTML and CSS.

Figma File Link: [YOUR_FIGMA_LINK]

Requirements:
1. Create a responsive webpage that matches the Figma design
2. Use only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript)
3. Implement proper responsive design with media queries
4. Add subtle animations and hover effects to enhance user experience
5. Organize the code in a clean, maintainable structure
6. Download all necessary images from the Figma design

Please help me implement this webpage by:
1. Analyzing the Figma design
2. Creating the basic HTML structure
3. Implementing the CSS styling
4. Adding responsive breakpoints
5. Enhancing the design with animations and hover effects

Note: If there's a demo-result folder in the repository, please ignore it as it contains a separate implementation example.

├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # CSS styling
├── images/             # Downloaded images from Figma
│   ├── [image files]
├── demo-result/        # Example implementation (my experiment results)
├── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Results

This approach resulted in a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma design with additional enhancements:

- Smooth animations and transitions
- Interactive hover effects
- Fully responsive layout
- Optimized image assets
- Clean, semantic HTML
- Well-organized CSS with variables for consistency

You can see a complete example of these results in the `demo-result` folder of this repository, which contains my own implementation using this approach.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Speed**: Convert designs to code much faster than manual coding
- **Accuracy**: Achieve pixel-perfect implementation of designs
- **Efficiency**: Reduce the tedious aspects of front-end development
- **Learning**: Study the generated code to improve your own skills
- **Iteration**: Quickly implement design changes and updates
